# CSS Art Workshop

### Inspiration
This workshop was inspired by [A Single Div](http://a.singlediv.com/). Check out the site - everything on that page is made purely out of HTML/CSS, no images at all!

### Goals
Although realistically most websites don't draw pictures with code, this workshop is a good exercise to learn more about CSS. In the process of making their drawings, participants will learn about the following:
- changing size and color
- creating different shapes (rectangles, rounded rectangles, circles, triangles)
- positioning and rotating shapes
- animation

### Target Audience
Participants should already have basic experience with HTML and CSS. Ideally, participants should be familiar with:
- Divs
- Classes and IDs

A quick review of these concepts are in Part 1.

### Setup
- Use [JSBin](http://jsbin.com), an online HTML/CSS editor. 
  - Similar alternatives include [CodePen](http://codepen.io) & [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) - feel free to use those if you prefer
  - Make an account to save work!
